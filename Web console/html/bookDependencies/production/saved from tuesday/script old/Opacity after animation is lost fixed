Animations were getting stuck at the last leg. Thought that was a bug, it was a workaround for "saving animations in their last state".
Had to get rid of that, so I set the anim.AT to false in the sequence, now you can drag animated objects.

BUT WAIT!!

What about animations that finish with an opacity, and need to keep it?

Well, now when an animation ends, the animation data is copied over to the actual data, problem solved.

BUT WAIT, regular objects don't have opacity!!

Added opacity to regular objects.

PROBLEM SOLVED MOTHERS!!!

Changes made in sequence (animation end, copy all last leg values to object) and load (all objects get an opacity prop, redraw function accounts for object opacity)
