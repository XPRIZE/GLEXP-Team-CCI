* Swipe right to allow modifications
* Choose "Backup"
* Check only "Data" partition
* Rename to current date stamp (MM-DD-YY)
* Swipe right to back up

Get the backup off the device. This can be accomplished two ways.

 - Easiest (maybe)
> cd /place/to/pull/backup (like your desktop or whatever)
> adb pull /sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/serialno/DATE_STAMP_OF_BACKUP
// (11-26-18 or someting)

Will pull folder to your shell's cwd

 - Harder (maybe?)
* Install generic MTP drivers
* Attempt to mound TWRP on local computer
* Install other MTP drivers
* still not showing up
* cry a lot
* ???
* Mount and pull backup from /sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/serialno/
