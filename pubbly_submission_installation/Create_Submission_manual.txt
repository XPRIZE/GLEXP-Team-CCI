DEVICES IS READY

Reboot into fastboot mode.
	-- Reboot to fastboot (Hold power, restart, hold power and vol down, select fastboot

Flash twrp 

unix > sudo fastboot flash recovery TWRP_3.2.3-0-dragon.img
ms   > fastboot flash recovery TWRP_3.2.3-0-dragon.img

Reboot

unix > sudo fastboot reboot
ms   > fastboot reboot

After reboot, during "OS verification off" warning, hold POWER and VOLUME DOWN buttons until you get to boot loader. Use VOLUME DOWN to hover over "Android Recovery", then POWER to select. You should reboot into TWRP recovery mode (black and yellow, not default android recovery). 

* Swipe right to allow modifications
* Choose "Backup"
* Check only "Data" partition
* Rename to current date stamp (MM-DD-YY)
* Swipe right to back up

Get the backup off the device. This can be accomplished two ways.

 - Easiest (maybe)
> cd /place/to/pull/backup (like your desktop or whatever)
> adb pull /sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/serialno/DATE_STAMP_OF_BACKUP
// (11-26-18 or someting)

Will pull folder to your shell's cwd

 - Harder (maybe?)
* Install generic MTP drivers
* Attempt to mound TWRP on local computer
* Install other MTP drivers
* still not showing up
* cry a lot
* ???
* Mount and pull backup from /sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/serialno/

THAT FOLDER on your desktop is what we submit to Xprize. The following are their install instructions. To check the build, reboot into fastboot mode

(which can be done with an adb command >adb reboot fastboot)

And wipe the userdata partition (ensuring you've got a fresh tablet)

> sudo fastboot format userdata

Woo. Go to build Install_Submission* to install on fresh tablets
