# Localization of CCI application

## Overview
There are 3 key components to localize CCI application.
1. **Desktop Design Tools**: A livecode cross platform application which is used to create a new _Pubbly_ project in order to generate content, add animations, images, videos which can then be exported as _.zip_ file.
2. **Pubbly Web Console**: The content that is exported by _Desktop Pubbly_ application is uploaded on _Pubbly Web Console_ application and then edited. This application is used to organize the assets and create XML and HTML files that can be downloaded and used in the _Cordova_ project.
3. **Cordova Project**: The downloaded content from _Pubbly Web Console_ application is then placed in _www_ folder of the _Cordova_ project i.e _CCI App_.

### Desktop Design Tools
Use [BuildInstructions.md](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-CCI/blob/master/pubbly_design_tools/Development/BuildInstructions.md) to install  _Desktop Pubbly_ application in order to create content. After creating the content, export the created project. `zip` the files to upload the same on _Pubbly Web Console_ application. For creating content in _Desktop Pubbly_ application you can refer [this](https://github.com/PubblyDevelopment/pubbly_design_tools#designers) link.

### Pubbly Web Console
Follow the instructions given in [Build instructions.txt](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-CCI/blob/master/Web%20console/Build%20instructions.txt) to build the _Pubbly Web Console_ application on localhost machine. Then follow the instructions mentioned below:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/Web%20console/html/login.php.
2. Register on _Pubbly Web Console_ application and then use those credentials to login.
3. There are 4 key sections to generate content for localization:
	1. **Maps**: This is used to create a Map which contains various games that can be generated by using the content uploaded in _Static Exports_ or _Variable Exports_ sections.
	2. **Static Exports**: [This is a dummy text as the steps to import content in Web Console are not clear]
	3. **Variable Exports**: This is used to build content by creating a _New Series_, assigning a unique name to the created series, uploading `zip` files that can be generated by using _Desktop Pubbly_ application and then using _Swap Interface_ for editing the content.
	4. **Stitch App**: This is used to create `School`, `Subjects`, `Lessons` and `Levels` which in turn consist of `Units` and `Games` with different difficulty levels according to the syllabus. The files that are uploaded by creating _Series_ using _Variable Exports_ are then used by the _Stitch App_ for editing `Units` and `Games`. 
7. [This is a dummy text as the steps to export content in Web Console are not clear].

### Cordova Project i.e. _CCI App_
1. Place the assets generated using _Pubbly Web Console application_ in _www_ folder of _Cordova_ project which can be created by following the instructions in _INSTALL.md_ file.
2. Ensure that the folder structure is like [EnglishWebRoot](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-CCI/tree/master/pubbly_schoolhouse/XprizePrograms/EnglishWebRoot).
