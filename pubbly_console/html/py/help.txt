- make folder in html/py/genOffline.cgi
- make sure you can get python/cgi files running -"hello world"
- get info about latest version from html/pubbly_engine/latest.txt
- copy run.html somewhere useful, from html/pubbly_engine/{version}/run.html
- get all map content from html/map/{name o' map}
- use a good test folder, like html/offlineMaps{name of map}
- after getErrors
	- add an index
	- zip everything
	- echo download link


(It's just a javascript refresh to where you want to start the map)
So add index.html, which is that html above with the name of the entry point of the map, which you can get from map/{MapName}/entryPoint.txt
Zip everything
• AllNode.html
• index.html
• pubbly_engine/
• map/
... Maybe move said zip to a "OfflineMapDownload/MapName.zip" folder
And echo the finished link
That should eliminate all your broken link problems, because the only html with broken links is just the run.html file, which you only use as a template for the node html files.
